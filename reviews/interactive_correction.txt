The authors 

Significance and Originality
I am not convinced of the tool's utility and applicability. I consider it limited in application until proven otherwise. It is an original adaptation of techniques from Aspect(?) stuff to the theorem proving setting.

Quality of Presentation

The paper has many grammatical errors (some listed below) and desperately requires more careful proof reading.

OAAO might be interesting to the authors?

- Difficult problem. (Semantics preserving transformations are easier)
- Seems limited in applicability: Many such changes can drastically alter proof and program structure. Maybe there is still a niche for this tool?
Suitability?
- Paper should make an effort to justify that this is a reasonable problem. It's stated, but not explained
(Identify good things in paper. It's not to comfort the authors, it's so they know what to keep).
Can't this drastically change the structure of proof terms? e.g. what if we have to change the format from a destruct to an inversion?
More advanced example? Dependent types?
