Explain in context of church rosser?

Problems:
\begin{enumerate}
\item {\tt member (of (app M N) T) G} should be discarded
\item Freshness: {\tt member (of x (T x)) (G x)} - we know that  {\tt x}
  does not occur in {\tt T}. Example? How do we handle this?
\item Pruning: {\tt member (E x) G} entails {\tt E}'s dependency on
  {\tt x} is vacuous. How to handle?
\item Know one ({\tt pr x x}) get others ({\tt cd x x} and {\tt notlam x}).
\item Functional relationships (only one type per variable)
\end{enumerate}

Block declarations:

n-ary worlds and blocks are defined: 
\begin{align*}
W_n &:= B_n | ... | B_n \\
B_n &:= \exists \vec{T}, \nabla \vec{x}, \underbrace{tl(\vec{x}, \vec{T}); ...;
tl(\vec{x}, \vec{T})}_{n} \\
tl(\vec{x}, \vec{T}) &:= t(\vec{x}, \vec{T}), ..., t(\vec{x}, \vec{T}) \\
t(\vec{x}, \vec{T}) &:= \text{term with variables drawn from } \vec{x} \text{
  and } \vec{T}
\end{align*}

- Nabla may not be the right binder
- Note that the $T$s are outside the scope of the $\nabla$ and hence
any dependency must be explicitly mentioned.
- Why? Because this jives better with translation into context
relations? 

Elaboration into relations:

Block b := nabla x, (pr x x; cd x x, notlam x)
World w := b1 | b2 | ... | bn

pr x x :- var x
wf x :- var x
