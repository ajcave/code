\item \textbf{Summary of Research Progress}
January 2014, submitted to ITP 2014: Andrew Cave and Brigitte Pientka. Mechanizing Logical Relations using Contextual Type Theory.

The LFMTP'13 paper and ITP'14 submission represent progress on extending contextual type theory to support effective mechanization of logical relations proofs for simply typed languages.
\item \textbf{Research Plan for the Next 12 Months:}  
Preparing to do thesis proposal in April 2014.

The goal is to extend my work on first-class substitutions to ``full'' dependent type theory supporting computation in types, which will enable effective mechanization of logical relations proofs for a wider variety of more realistic languages. To illustrate this, I intend to develop more motivating examples: mechanizing step-indexed logical relations proofs for reasoning about higher-order programs with effects and normalization for dependent type theories with features such as large eliminations. I have carried out initial attempts at these proofs in traditional proof assistants (Coq, Agda), which suggest that such proofs are feasible to mechanize and would greatly benefit from support for first-class substitutions.
